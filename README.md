# [Data Structures and Algorithms course] Knapsack Problem

## Implement some algorithms:

We implement and compare time complexity, space complexity of some algorithms:

- Brute Force
- Meet-in-the-middle
- Brute Force using Memorization technique
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy
- Branch and Bound

## Result

Compute and compare execution time (in milliseconds) of above algorithms. Find code [here.](./Testing/TesingComplexity.py)
